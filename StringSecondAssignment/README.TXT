Genemic String:- The genome of an organism stores all the genetic information necessary to build and maintain that organism. This genetic information is stored as a long list or sting over the four letter alphabet A, T, C, and G
These four characters correspond to the four DNA bases, adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine.
The sheer size of the genome makes it difficult, if not impossible, to analyze by hand. The human genome, for example, contains 3 billion characters. That is 1 million times more than the characters shown here. Thus finding any information in the genome requires computational approaches. In addition, the genome is complex and contains different types of information. Computational approaches are neede...

PROJECT TITLE: Print all the valid and possile genes in a DNA Strand. 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT:To find out the genes from the large dna strand needs a computational work.
VERSION or DATE:23/07/2020
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT:This works well on java supported IDE the one should install the java packages.
